NJ Municipal Merger Project

## What are municipal mergers? 

Municipal mergers are a oft-used solution to administrative inefficiency. By merging two municipalities, many of the costs of running two municipalities would then be one. There is debate over the effectiveness of such policies, however they have been successful with national, top-down policies (for more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merger_(politics) ). 

## Why New Jersey? 

New Jersey has a lot of municipalities relative to its area. 565 to be exact. Due to New Jersey's high local and state taxes, there have been efforts to initiate municipal mergers as a possible solution. 

## So what is this? 

I decided to try to model a state-wide merger policy that distributes geography evenly. The model takes a population minimum and merges until all new munis. meet the requirement. Town names are combined, new muncipal codes are crafted, and population and population density values are both re-calculated.

## Requirements...

- ArcMap 10+. I know, I'm sorry. 
- NJ municipalities shapefile or feature class that contains the population values for each municipality. If you would like to    use this program, just message or e-mail me for this file!
- Patience...while the original methodology for this program ran for literally 15 hours for the entire state, this one still   takes around an hour. Not too bad, especially if you are only doing one or two counties (roughly 5-10 minutes per county).
